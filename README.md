Building
========

Benchmarks and tests can be built by executing the build program, SCons.

```
$ scons
```

Note: the program currently cannot be built without my benchmarking and unit
testing libraries. Feel free to write your own benchmarks in the meanwhile.

Executing Benchmarks
====================

Benchmarks can be executed by running the benchmark executable, `benchmark`, in
the `build/bin` directory.
